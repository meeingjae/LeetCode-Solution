# 9. Palindrome Number
-- --

Given an integer ```x```, return ```true``` if ```x``` is palindrome integer.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

* For example, ```121``` is a palindrome while ```123``` is not.


### Example 1:

> **Input:** x = 121
> 
> **Output:** true
> 
> **Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2:

> **Input:** x = -121
> 
> **Output:** false
> 
> **Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

### Example 3:

> **Input:** x = 10
> 
> **Output:** false
> 
> **Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


### Constraints:

* ```-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1```
